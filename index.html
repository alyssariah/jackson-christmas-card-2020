                    <h2>January</h2>
                    <p>We made the best of President’s Day weekend and camped out in Redwood National Park, camping
                        right along the river bank. One of our less-organized outings, we forgot some of the basics like
                        matches and utensils, but overall it was a great trip!</p>

                    <p>Right before Alyssa started her coding bootcamp, Alyssa’s parents and brother flew out to
                        California to spend some time with us. Our favorite outing was visiting Alcatraz. So glad they
                        visited it before we moved! </p>

                    <p>Brian didn’t get in as much as hiking this year as he’d prefer, but was able to get away with our
                        friend Craig to “scratch the itch,” scratching the 20-mile Sea-to-Summit Cone Peak hike off the
                        list. It was one of Brian’s favorite hikes so far!</p>

                    <p>Right as the California shelter-in-place restrictions were tightening down, we decided to foster
                        a husky. Morgan was a crazy, stubborn, and sassy pup who loves to run, chew, and chase
                        everything. Although working from home in our 300 sqft studio with a husky had its challenges,
                        we have so many good memories! After spending 2 months with us, Morgan found a good home.</p>

                    <p>Before we left California, we had to do one last drive up and down the PCH. Alyssa’s Aunt Geri
                        (and Uncle Troy) was very generous and let us borrow her BMW Z3 Roadster for the day, so we can
                        now say we’ve driven the PCH in a convertible. And yes, that turkey-cheddar-bacon sandwich on
                        fresh-baked SF sourdough was as good as it looks!</p>

                    <p>Definitely one of the highlights of the year, we got to visit Yosemite a week after it re-opened,
                        and thanks to COVID, enjoyed it without the crowds. Not sure how, but Alyssa agreed to spend
                        another anniversary backpacking in a tent! The hike up to the North Rim was gruelling, but the
                        views from our campsite made it worth it!</p>

                        National Parks, checking off Yosemite, Great Basin, Bryce Canyon, Mesa Verde, and Black Canyon
                        of the Gunnison. We got in a lot of great hikes (and others where Alyssa hated Brian

                        beautiful rivers, breathtaking fall colors, and many parks. The people here have been incredibly
                        kind, welcoming, and friendly (sorry Texas, Pittsburgh has you beat). Although the pandemic has
                        made it difficult to get to know people, we’re excited to make new friends and get to know the
                        city even better over the next several years.</p>

                    <p>We closed on our first home! The process was long and difficult, but after nearly 4 months of
                        living out of a car and suitcases, we were ready to have a place of our own. It’s a 100 years
                        old and has some quirks, but we love it! We have a stream going through our backyard, are a 2
                        minute walk from the Monongahela River trail, and a 5 mile bike ride to CMU (which Brian may end
                        up doing as some point, but for now is taking classes and doing research from home). </p>

                        bridge across the creek in our backyard. Brian dusted off his old engineering textbooks, and
                        hauled a bunch of cement. Brian’s brother Hyrum came out to help before being stationed
                        overseas. It took a while, and still has more to do, but at least we have access to our backyard
                        now! </p>

                        understatement. In California she volunteered with Guide Dogs for the Blind and worked as a
                        trainer at the Humane Society and Petco. She’s been patiently waiting for her own dog for a long
                        time! River is a fiesty Golden Irish who loves attention but is stubbornly independent. She’s
                        been a challenge but Alyssa is up for it!</p>
